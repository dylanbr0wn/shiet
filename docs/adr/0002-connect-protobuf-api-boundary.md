# ADR-0002: Connect and Protobuf API Boundary

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-09
- Linear: DYL-94

## Context

shiet's React frontend currently calls the local Go process through generated
Wails bindings. That is a good native integration mechanism, but it is not a
network contract that a future browser client can reuse. The OAuth broker has a
separate hand-written JSON contract whose request and response structs have
also been repeated in the broker and desktop provider packages.

Native gRPC is not directly available to browser JavaScript. gRPC-Web adapts
the protocol for browsers, traditionally with a translating proxy, and does
not support every native streaming shape. Connect provides generated Go and
TypeScript APIs over ordinary HTTP while its Go handlers also accept Connect,
gRPC-Web, and gRPC clients.

A transport change alone does not create a hosted web product. User identity,
tenant ownership, hosted persistence, browser sessions, and the privacy impact
of moving local SQLite/keychain data remain separate architecture decisions.

## Decision

Use versioned Protobuf contracts and Connect for portable shiet APIs:

- `shiet.app.v1` contains every application operation that can make sense on
  either a desktop-local or future hosted service. Its versioned services cover
  periods, categories, calendars and sync, schedules and review decisions,
  settings, integration metadata, and export rendering/templates.
- `shiet.broker.v1` contains the provider-neutral OAuth broker start, handoff,
  refresh, and revoke operations. Generated messages replace duplicated wire
  shapes in new desktop clients.
- Go Connect handlers are the RPC implementation. They accept Connect,
  gRPC-Web, and gRPC protocols; browser TypeScript uses the Connect protocol.
- Generated sources are Git-ignored and reproduced locally and in CI from
  generator versions pinned with Buf.

The application RPC handler delegates to the existing `service.Service`; it
does not move business rules into the transport. Generated Protobuf messages
remain behind `frontend/src/lib/api/shietService.ts`, which maps `int64` IDs to
JavaScript numbers only after checking the safe-integer range.

Wails binds only operations whose implementation is intrinsically desktop
native: OAuth browser/loopback and keychain flows, local AI
discovery/configuration, and the native save
dialog. Export content is rendered through Connect and then passed to the
native save adapter. `service.Service` itself is not Wails-bound.

Low-level dependency and merge seams (`SetCalendarSync`, `SetEvidence`, and
`SyncEvents`) are internal service APIs, not frontend operations, and are
intentionally exposed through neither Connect nor Wails. The explicit Connect
surface includes the previously bound portable reads (`GetPeriod`,
`GetPeriodByRange`, `GetCategory`, `GetEvent`, `GetExportTemplate`) and the
period export aggregation.

The broker replaces its handwritten REST operations with the generated Connect
service. There are no released users requiring a compatibility period, so this
branch is a hard transport switch: desktop clients use the generated Connect-Go
client and the broker exposes no REST aliases or fallback behavior for start,
handoff, refresh, or revoke.

Google, GitHub, and Slack callbacks remain ordinary HTTP GET routes because providers
navigate the user agent to those endpoints with `code` and `state`. Health,
readiness, and Prometheus metrics also remain ordinary HTTP endpoints.

## Security and compatibility

- The broker's no-persistent-token decision from ADR-0001 is unchanged.
  Protobuf token messages are transient and must never be logged or added to
  metrics.
- Broker Connect endpoints do not enable cross-origin browser access. A future
  browser client needs an explicit application-session/BFF decision before it
  may use token-bearing operations.
- Stable broker error identifiers are returned as Connect error details.
- Google is the only provider supporting refresh. GitHub and Slack refresh return
  `Unimplemented`; revoke validates that Google supplies a refresh token and
  GitHub and Slack supply access tokens.
- Wails v2's AssetServer supports unary POST handlers, but its documentation
  warns about Vite 5 development-server routing and unsupported response
  streaming on Windows. The application services are unary and share the same
  AssetServer handler path verified by the initial period slice. If a future
  transport shape proves unreliable, use a loopback-only server with a
  per-process capability token and exact-origin CORS rather than exposing an
  unauthenticated local port.

## Alternatives considered

### Keep Wails bindings and handwritten broker JSON only

Smallest short-term change, but it leaves no reusable browser contract and
continues duplicating broker wire types.

### Native grpc-go everywhere

Appropriate for trusted server-to-server traffic, but browser clients cannot
use native gRPC directly. A separate gRPC-Web layer or proxy would still be
required.

### Route native capabilities through Connect

Rejected because a network-shaped contract does not make file dialogs,
keychain access, local runtime discovery, or desktop OAuth handoff portable.
Those operations remain explicit platform adapters while the complete portable
surface uses Connect.

### Keep REST alongside Connect

Rejected because there are no released users to migrate. A dual transport
would add schema, tests, fallback behavior, and replay risk without providing
compatibility value.
