# ADR-0002: Connect and Protobuf API Boundary

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-09
- Linear: DYL-94

## Context

shiet's React frontend currently calls the local Go process through generated
Wails bindings. That is a good native integration mechanism, but it is not a
network contract that a future browser client can reuse. The OAuth broker has a
separate hand-written JSON contract whose request and response structs have
also been repeated in the broker and desktop provider packages.

Native gRPC is not directly available to browser JavaScript. gRPC-Web adapts
the protocol for browsers, traditionally with a translating proxy, and does
not support every native streaming shape. Connect provides generated Go and
TypeScript APIs over ordinary HTTP while its Go handlers also accept Connect,
gRPC-Web, and gRPC clients.

A transport change alone does not create a hosted web product. User identity,
tenant ownership, hosted persistence, browser sessions, and the privacy impact
of moving local SQLite/keychain data remain separate architecture decisions.

## Decision

Use versioned Protobuf contracts and Connect for portable shiet APIs:

- `shiet.app.v1` contains application operations that can make sense on either
  a desktop-local or future hosted service. The first vertical slice is period
  listing and current-period creation.
- `shiet.broker.v1` contains the provider-neutral OAuth broker start, handoff,
  refresh, and revoke operations. Generated messages replace duplicated wire
  shapes in new desktop clients.
- Go Connect handlers are the RPC implementation. They accept Connect,
  gRPC-Web, and gRPC protocols; browser TypeScript uses the Connect protocol.
- Generated sources are checked in and generator versions are pinned with Buf.

The application RPC handler delegates to the existing `service.Service`; it
does not move business rules into the transport. Generated Protobuf messages
remain behind `frontend/src/lib/api/shietService.ts`, which maps `int64` IDs to
JavaScript numbers only after checking the safe-integer range.

The broker exposes its generated Connect service alongside the existing REST
API. Both transports delegate to the same start, handoff, refresh, and revoke
operations so one-time use, rate limits, kill switches, metrics, and token
handling cannot drift. REST response adapters preserve the released
snake_case JSON shapes for existing desktop builds. New desktop builds use the
generated Connect-Go client. They retry through the released REST API only when
the broker definitively reports that the Connect procedure is unimplemented;
ambiguous network or server failures are never replayed across transports.

Google and GitHub callbacks remain ordinary HTTP GET routes because providers
navigate the user agent to those endpoints with `code` and `state`. Health,
readiness, and Prometheus metrics also remain ordinary HTTP endpoints.

## Security and compatibility

- The broker's no-persistent-token decision from ADR-0001 is unchanged.
  Protobuf token messages are transient and must never be logged or added to
  metrics.
- Broker Connect endpoints do not enable cross-origin browser access. A future
  browser client needs an explicit application-session/BFF decision before it
  may use token-bearing operations.
- Stable broker error identifiers are returned as Connect error details while
  legacy REST clients continue receiving `{"error":"..."}`.
- Google is the only provider supporting refresh. GitHub refresh returns
  `Unimplemented`; revoke validates that Google supplies a refresh token and
  GitHub supplies an access token.
- Wails v2's AssetServer supports unary POST handlers, but its documentation
  warns about Vite 5 development-server routing and unsupported response
  streaming on Windows. This slice is unary, and its Connect POST was verified
  through both the packaged app and the Wails development server. If a future
  transport shape proves unreliable, use a loopback-only server with a
  per-process capability token and exact-origin CORS rather than exposing an
  unauthenticated local port.

## Alternatives considered

### Keep Wails bindings and handwritten broker JSON only

Smallest short-term change, but it leaves no reusable browser contract and
continues duplicating broker wire types.

### Native grpc-go everywhere

Appropriate for trusted server-to-server traffic, but browser clients cannot
use native gRPC directly. A separate gRPC-Web layer or proxy would still be
required.

### Replace every Wails method immediately

Rejected as an unsafe horizontal migration. Native-only capabilities such as
file dialogs, clipboard access, keychain storage, and desktop handoff belong
behind platform adapters. Portable operations can move incrementally through
the stable frontend API facade.

### Remove the broker REST API

Rejected because already-released desktop builds depend on it. REST and
Connect coexist during migration and share the same operation implementation.
